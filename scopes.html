                    Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases at
                    present, a disease that cannot be cured but can be treated by
                    medications and healthy lifestyles. To prevent fatal complications,
                    treatments need to be provided. Diabetes has different stages, such
                    as prediabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, etc. , and each
                    stage can be diagnosed by different types of medical laboratory
                    tests. Typically, a sample of blood, urine, or other bodily fluids
                    are taken by medical laboratories for tests to diagnose or monitor
                    diseases, and for diabetes, mostly blood samples are taken into
                    consideration. A few of the blood tests that are taken to diagnose
                    diabetes are, HA1C, FBS, HDL, etc. Patients who are diagnosed with
                    diabetes should track their blood glucose levels regularly. Even
                    though blood sugar monitoring devices exist, the inability to afford
                    one has led patients to visit medical laboratories and doctors
                    regularly. According to doctors, most of the patients lack the
                    knowledge of their diseases, symptoms, and medications. Thus, to get
                    a comprehensive analysis, patients must visit a physician who is a
                    time-consuming process. According to the literature review, it was
                    discovered that few machine learning techniques had been used to
                    screen prediabetes and diabetes. The following articles and research
                    papers are related to background study about literature review.
                    Screening for Prediabetes Using Machine Learning Models. This study
                    aimed at developing an intelligence-based screening model for
                    prediabetes. Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition
                    Examination Survey (KNHANES) were used, excluding subjects with
                    diabetes. The KNHANES 2010 data (n = 4685) were used for training
                    and internal validation, while data from KNHANES 2011 (n = 4566)
                    were used for external validation. Two models were developed to
                    screen for prediabetes using an artificial neural network (ANN) and
                    support vector machine (SVM). They performed a systematic evaluation
                    of the models using internal and external validat io n. The
                    performance of our models was compared with that of a screening
                    score model 3 based on logistic regression analysis for prediabetes
                    that had been developed previously. The SVM model showed the areas
                    under the curve of 0.731 in the external datasets, which is higher
                    than those of the ANN model (0.729) and the screening score model
                    (0.712), respectively. Predictive models for diabetes mellitus using
                    machine learning techniques [7]. BMC Endocr Disord 19, 101 (2019).
                    This research was done using the most recent records of 13,309
                    Canadian patients aged between 18 and 90 years, along with their
                    laboratory information (age, sex, fasting blood glucose, body mass
                    index, high-dens ity lipoprotein, triglycerides, blood pressure, and
                    low-density lipoprotein), Predictive models were built using
                    Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) techniques.
                    The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC)
                    was used to evaluate the discriminatory capability of these models.
                    The adjusted threshold method and the class weight method were used
                    to improve sensitivity – the proportion of Diabetes Mellitus
                    patients correctly predicted by themodel. According to previous
                    research, a clinical test results reader [9] has been built; where
                    the user should enter test results manually, then the system will
                    alert the user via messages after analyzing the entered results.
                    Subsequently, to avoid manual entering of data by the user, Optical
                    Character Recognition (OCR) [9] and image processing techniques were
                    used by some researches [10]. But then again, OCR engine failed to
                    identify medical terms and units of volume in reports [10]. Since
                    OCR failed to identify medical terms, previous research has proposed
                    a system to create a knowledge base in a spreadsheet to identify
                    medical terms [11]. This spreadsheet contains definitions of medical
                    tests and test headers. This approach was successful to a certain
                    extent, but there is no relationship among the data in
                    thespreadsheet. A research carried out by Souad Larabi-Marie-Sainte,
                    Linah Aburahmah, Rana Almohaini and Tanzila Saba on current
                    technique s for Diabetes prediction[12]; the researches have
                    explored the most suitable, robust set of deep learning algorithms
                    to 4 predict diabetes. In this research, various machine learning
                    (ML), deep learning (DL) algorithms have been taken into
                    consideration and comparison based on the accuracy of the results.
                    The research surveyed all the ML, DL techniques for diabetes
                    prediction in the last six years. The article explores Decision
                    Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression, and
                    Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning techniques.
                    Kandhasamy and Balamurali [13] have used various classifiers such as
                    SVM, J48, KNearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The
                    classification was performed on a dataset obtained from the UCI
                    repository. The results of the classifiers were compared based on
                    the values of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The
                    researchers have cleaned noise from the data and reported that the
                    decision tree j48 classifier has the highest accuracy rate being
                    73.82% without data pre-processing. In comparison, the classifiers
                    KNN (k=1) and Random Forest. The classification was performed on a
                    dataset obtained from the UCI repository. The results of the
                    classifiers were compared based on the values of accuracy,
                    sensitivity, and specificity. The researchers have cleaned noise
                    from the data and reported that the decision tree j48 classifier has
                    the highest accuracy rate being 73.82% without data pre-processing.
                    In comparison, the classifiers KNN (k=1) and Random Forest showed an
                    accuracy rate of 100% after data was pre-processed.

                <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify">
                    According to the related works based on developing the accuracy of
                    the extracted data from an Optical Character Recognition, it was
                    found that systems have been proposed to build a medical report
                    reader. Tesseract OCR is not capable of identifying some characters.
                    Micro (μ), which is used as a unit of volume, according to previous
                    research, they failed to identify this character. Since medical
                    reports use this unit more often, Tesseract could not identify this
                    character. It does not have the type of the test name in the report.
                    OCR by itself cannot identify the type of the report, and at
                    present, no solution has been provided to handle such a situation.
                    Recent studies have shown that the stress level of the patient is
                    also one of the main factors to consider when diagnosing prediabetes
                    or diabetes . The Scopes of most of the existing studies are limited
                    to implementing a machine learning model which facilitate the
                    general input factors which mentioned above, and there arises a need
                    to study and analyze the procedure of diagnosing/predicting
                    prediabetes/ diabetes with a high percentage of accuracy considering
                    the factors extracted from the medical reports and the stressmarker.
                    Recent studies based on related works on early diagnosis of
                    diabetes, the progression of Body Mass Index(BMI), blood glucose
                    level, and combined with age and gender should be taken as input
                    data to train the prediction model. Currently, there are no systems
                    available to track the data on period and predict the probability of
                    being diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases due to the prevalent
                    conditions of Diabetes, which arises the need for the proposed
                    system. AACE/ACE (American Association Of Clinical Endocrinologists
                    American College 6 Of Endocrinology) Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes
                    Management Algorithm has not been implemented in related systems at
                    present. According to the literature survey details gathered, most
                    of the existing solutions are developed to work as a medical
                    chatbot. Those interaction systems are not developed, aiming for a
                    specific area. Machine Learning algorithm will be used to find the
                    most suitable patient based on the patient’s details.

                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px">
                    As per recent statistics by the International Diabetes Federation
                    (IDF), one in 12 adults has diabetes in Sri Lanka, which is
                    approximately equal to 1.16 million of the population. The
                    anticipated diabetes predominance for the year 2030 is 13.9%.
                    Diabetes is a disease that cannot be cured, whereas prevention and
                    control are the only two ways to treat diabetes. Many people get
                    diagnosed with diabetes due to a lack of knowledge of their symptoms
                    and diseases. When instructions to mainta in diabetes were not given
                    to patients on time, the situation can lead them to increase the
                    risk of developing their disease to the next level. Patients are
                    unable to track the progression of the disease and the progression
                    of the key factors that affect cardiovascular diseases as currently,
                    there is no system capable of achieving this task. To control this
                    disease, medications and regular monitoring are required throughout
                    life. Therefore, the patient should frequently visit a physician who
                    is tiring and time - consuming for the patient as well as for the
                    doctor. To bridge this gap between the doctor and the patient, no
                    practical solution has been implemented yet. Expendit ures for
                    medications are also considerably high. Several mobile applications
                    exist at present to help diabetic patients. For most of the
                    applications, data needs to be entered manually, and then the
                    application keeps track of the medications, food, blood sugar
                    levels, etc. According to the entered values, the system suggests
                    suitable food or medications. Since patients lack the knowledge of
                    medical terms, entering values manually is error-prone and
                    time-consuming. Thus, an application is needed which can diagnose
                    /predict pre-diabetes or diabetes and make suggestions for a healthy
                    lifestyle by scanning and analyzing a medical laboratory report
                    while bridging the gap between the patient and the doctor.
